                            Bupropion SR (generic Wellbutrin SR) is a prescription medication used to treat depression.
                            Bupropion
                            can also effectively treat symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a condition
                            characterized by
                            depression that happens around the same time every year, often in winter. It has also been
                            used

                            <strong>What is bupropion SR and bupropion XL?</strong><br>
                            Bupropion SR and bupropion XL (generic Wellbutrin SR and Wellbutrin XL) are both
                            antidepressants, or
                            norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs). They both prevent the neurotransmitters
                            norepinephrine and dopamine from being reabsorbed into nerve cells, resulting in higher
                            levels
                            of
                            these substances in the brain. It has also been used by doctors to help patients quit
                            smoking.
                            While
                            similar in name, these two drugs should not be used interchangeably. The main difference
                            between
                            bupropion SR and bupropion XL is that bupropion SR is a sustained-release drug, while
                            bupropion
                            XL is
                            an extended-release drug. Because the XL version is delivered more slowly into your body, it
                            lasts
                            longer in your system. This may result in fewer adverse effects and a reduction in the
                            number of
                            times the medication must be taken. Talk to your doctor directly about which bupropion
                            prescription is
                            right for you.

                        <h3>What is bupropion used to treat?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Bupropion is commonly prescribed to treat depression and Seasonal Affective Disorder. It may
                            also be
                            prescribed, along with nicotine replacement therapy, to help patients quit smoking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The CDC estimates that almost 19% of Americans exhibited some symptoms of depression in
                            2019.
                            Often
                            caused by chemical imbalances in the brain, depression is characterized by a persistently
                            depressed
                            mood and a loss of interest in activities. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), is a type of
                            depression
                            that occurs around the same time (usually around the fall and winter) every year. Seasonal
                            Affective
                            Disorder can result in feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, and social withdrawal. Bupropion
                            may
                            be
                            prescribed as a long-term treatment of these conditions, along with other medication and
                            therapy.

                        <h3>How does bupropion work?</h3>
                        <p>
                            While bupropion’s effect on the brain is not fully understood, it works as a dopamine and
                            norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI). Dopamine and norepinephrine are two chemicals
                            produced
                            naturally in the brain that are responsible for stabilizing your mood and telling your brain
                            to
                            feel
                            happy. Sometimes, though, your brain reabsorbs these chemicals too quickly after they are
                            produced,
                            inhibiting them from doing their job and making you feel good. This process is called
                            “reuptake.”
                            Bupropion is a reuptake inhibitor, meaning it keeps the body from absorbing these chemicals
                            too
                            quickly.
                            This can improve mood and stimulate the “reward pathways” that can help alleviate symptoms
                            of
                            depression and SAD.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These same effects play a part in bupropion’s use as an anti-smoking aid. By blocking
                            dopamine
                            reuptake in the brain, bupropion helps reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms that may occur
                            as
                            you
                            stop smoking. Because bupropion elongates feelings of motivation and reward by blocking
                            dopamine
                            reuptake, the urge to smoke is reduced. This, along with nicotine replacement therapy, has
                            been
                            shown to
                            be very effective in helping patients quit smoking.

                            Bupropion is quickly metabolized and is easily tolerable for most patients. Side effects are
                            generally
                            more mild and manageable than most antidepressant medications. There are some common side
                            effects,
                            however, that you may still encounter. These may include:
